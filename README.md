## Background

<br>

The unemployment rate is considered one of the most important economic indicators. It measures the share of workers in the labor force who do not currently have a job but are actively looking for work. However, the issue of unemployment is a significant concern that has garnered considerable attention in the United States, particularly in the wake of the pandemic. 

Despite efforts to promote equal opportunities for all, disparities still exist between various demographic groups. According to BLS reports(https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/race-and-ethnicity/2021/home.htm), the unemployment rate averaged 8.6 percent for Blacks, 8.2 percent for American Indians and Alaska Natives, 6.9 percent for Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders, 5.0 percent for Asians, and 4.7 percent for Whites.

## Research Question

<br>

The purpose of this report is to conduct a thorough examination of employment data and its correlation with relevant factors in the United States. By delving into the root causes of employment disparities, we can identify potential solutions that will help to create a more just and equitable society. In particular, we seek to answer the question: "Is there a correlation between unemployment rate and gender, race, and income?"

By conducting this analysis, we hope to shed light on the complex interplay of factors that influence employment in the United States. Through this understanding, we can work towards creating more effective policies and initiatives that promote greater economic and social equity for all Americans.
